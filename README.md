A Celebrities guessing game using JavaScript + DOM + ESLint
Demo: 

- The content of the game was created by your javascript code (html elements, events handling)
- The user should enter their name (it will be stored along with their score). This should be validated by your program as an alphanumeric string. 
- Your webapp should display a picture of a celebrity one at a time and ask the user the guess/pick the name of the celebrity. You should provide 4 potential answers with one being the correct one. 
- The game contains about 50 celebrities, which are picked the celebrity randomly.
- The game will keep track of the user’s score , and display three scores: the current score, the current user’s best score, and the overall best score on the computer/browser. 
- The game stores the user names along with the scores (current, best personal, all time best) in the browser’s localstorage. The scores will update each time user gets higher score.
